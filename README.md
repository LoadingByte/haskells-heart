# Haskell's Heart

A heart-shaped Haskell program which prints an animated pulsating heart.

I originally coded this as a Valentine's Day present for my girlfriend.
It's the ultimate tool to make someone fall for you.
However, with great power comes great responsibility.
Use it only as the last resort if even the computer scientist mating dance has failed you.
